        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

        <h4>That Game Company</h4>

        <p>
          The game Journey uses the Rule of Thirds and Golden Ratio extensively.
          The game developers implemented some of these designs on their
          website. As you can see, the lower third is dedicated to the main
          character of Journey, the middle third shows the gamin platforms, and
          the top third has the mountain.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Google Fi</h4>
        <p><a href="https://fi.google.com" target="_blank">fi.google.com</a></p>
        <img
          src="images/google_fi-lg.jpg"
          alt="Meet Google Fi a different kind of phone plan"
        />
        <p>
          Google is known for making good use of white space and clean, simple
          design. Here there is a lot of literal white space to emphasize the
          importance of each section. I found it interesting that there was
          always a little bit of color in each section to draw the eye and keep
          you scrolling through the page. This effect is more pronounced because
          of all the empty space surrounding it.

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Wix</h4>
        <p><a href="https://wix.com" tarrget="_blank">wix.com</a></p>
        <img
          src="images/wix-lg.jpg"
          alt="Wix Create a Website You're Proud Of"
        />
        <p>
          The Wix website uses both color and size to establish a visual
          hierarchy. The first thing you see is Create a Website You're Proud
          Of. Next they have a call to action with the Get Started button. That
          there is a clear order of information to tell the viewer where to
          start and where to go from there.
