        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The ideal audience would be people who want/need to check the weather
          frequently. They might need to check it multiple times a day.

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Jerry: Jerry is a construction site supervisor and is outside all
            day. He works at different locations throughout the day and the
            weather can change a lot depending on where he is. He always wants
            to check the weather before he goes so he doesn’t get caught out in
            the rain or stuck in inclement weather with the wrong equipment. He
            also needs to tell his workers what kind of gear they are going to
            need and when they will need to shut down the work because of the
            weather. He wants something quick and easy to look at so he can tell
            right away what he would need to do since he is a busy man.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jessica: Jessica is a stay at home mom with two little kids. She
            often goes outside to take her kids for a walk. Whenever it rains,
            she has to spend a lot of time to get them ready and clean up after
            them when they’re done. She wants to make sure her kids are safe and
            she knows how to dress them appropriately.

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Jerry is going out of town to a worksite. He notices it is cloudy
            outside, but he remembers hearing something about rain on the news
            last night. He goes to the website to see if the job site will
            experience any rain during the day.
